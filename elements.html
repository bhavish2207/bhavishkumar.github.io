											<h3>2012-2016: Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering</h3>
											<p>A deep interest in science, mathematics and technology since my childhood led me to pursuing a career in engineering and technology. 
											After having excelled in my high school class 12 board examinations with a score of 96% in Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics, 
											I opted for electronics and communication engineering from Cochin University of Science and Technology for my bachelor’s degree. My first encounter with the potential of the field 
											of data science was during the second year of undergraduate studies. My fascination for data science has only grown since then.</p>

											<h3>2015 May-June: Summer Internship at Ernst & Young</h3>
											<p>My penchant to gain hands-on exposure to concepts of data science helped me land an internship offer with Ernst and Young (Trivandrum, India). 
											My role as an intern was to implement a human tracking system with the help of Wi-Fi signal extracted from one’s phone using Python and SQL. 
											This 2-month stint proved valuable in terms of exposing me to data management techniques using SQL and Python programming, 
											which is widely used to tackle data science problems.</p>

											<h3>2016-2019: Decision Scientist at Mu Sigma Business Solutions Pvt Ltd</h3>
											<p>Given my inherent analytical skills and internship experience, 
											I was offered a job at Mu Sigma (Bangalore, India), 
											a dream decision sciences company to work with for aspiring data scientists.
											At Mu Sigma, I worked on a competitor analysis project for a major fortune 10 eCommerce client. 
											Some of my responsibilities included reporting monthly scores using past data, refreshing dashboards, building web applications 
											and heading a team of 4 that automated a framework using PySpark & data pipelines. 
											I have been a diligent worker and a quick learner, which earned me four 
											<a href="https://github.com/bhavish2207/Spot-Awards-Documents" target="_blank" style="color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">"Spot Awards"</a>, 
											in quick succession, as a token of recognition of my deft project execution.
											Working with Mu Sigma served as an eye-opener in helping me understand the whole new paradigm of data science and 
											I was able to totally relate and apply my knowledge and analytical skills on real-world client projects.

											<h3>2019-Present: Syracuse University, School of Information Studies</h3>
											<p>The cumulative experiences of my education and work experience had instilled a deep passion in me to pursue master's in data science to scale up the knowledge ladder.
											This passion is what brought me to Syracuse University for my Masters in Applied Data Science.
											I will be graduating in May 2021 and my goal is to graduate with a bag full of knowledge & skillset on a wide variety Data Science Tools, Techniques and Technologies,
											which will make me a complete Data Scientist.
