										<h2>Database Design, Management<br />
										& Warehousing</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/sql.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
									Working for 3 years experience as a Decision Scientist for Mu Sigma Business Solutions, has made me well versed with Database Design, Data Extraction, Transformation, Loading and Warehousing concepts, owing to a tremendous amount of hands on experience and practical exposure. 
									<br/>In addition to this, extensive use of 'SQL' on 'MS SQL Server' for complex Data Manipulations & Business Report generations, have also contributed to my proficiency in SQL.
									Moreover, while working on an Analytics project for a major eCommerce client I had used 'SQL' extensively on 'PySpark' and 'Hadoop/Hive' Big Data platforms to generate KPI metric scores and feed the datamarts.

										<h2>Statistics & Machine Learning</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/statsml.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My in-depth understanding and knowledge in Descriptive & Inferential Statistics (Regression, Distributions, Probability, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing & Time Series Forecasting)
									can be attributed to the course "MBC 638-Data Analysis and Decision Making" which I completed as part of my master's program at Syracuse University. I excelled in this course with a score of 96 percentile.
									<br/>I have also learnt several Data Mining/Machine Learning and Statistical Learning techniques (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Association Rules Mining), which I implemented using R, Python and PySpark as part of the courses "IST 707-Data Analytics" and "IST 718-Big Data Analytics", which I completed as part of my master's program.
									<br/>Moreover, working on client projects at Mu Sigma and at iConsult Collaborative have given me sufficient exposure to Data Mining on real world data.

									  <h2>Data Visualization & Dashboarding</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I have built several user interactive web applications (dashboards) on R Shiny as part of my client project at Mu Sigma and also as part of my academic projects. These dashboards help to visually track, analyze and display the metrics, along with their key data points and trends/patterns in the data. I have also enhanced the user interface of the dashboard through the use of HTML & CSS styling.</p>

									  <h2>Text Mining & Natural Language Processing</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/nlp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I have learnt several text processing techniques (Tokenization, n-gram feature extraction, Vectorization, Exploratory Text Analysis etc.) that are used to convert unstructured text data to structured data (Term-Document Matrix) which is suitable for Machine Learning. Completion of the courses "IST 664-Natural Language Processing", "IST 736-Text Mining" and their respective projects helped me learn these text processing techniques and also gain hands on experience with their implementation. I also got to learn and implement topic modeling algorithms such as LDA & NMF.</p>
